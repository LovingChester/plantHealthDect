# Plant Health Detection
## Abstract
Early detection of plant diseases plays an important role in agriculture, as it is directly related to the quality and yield of the agricultural products. There are two sources contributing to the diseases, living organisms such as viruses, bacteria, fungi, etc, and environmental factors such as drought, heat, cold, etc. Despite significant efforts being made to overcome these diseases, the problem of quality and yield loss remains crucial. Even today, in most of the places in the world, disease inspections on plants are still done manually. Most of the time, farmers inspect the disease either based on the guideline, which requires a high level of experience and skills, or based on the requested technical support, which is very costly and time consuming. Hence, an automated way to identify the plant diseases is necessary for agricultural development.
